## Game Concept

In the mini game, the player aim to repel alien invasion with their one and only guitar. In this postapocalyptic world, there is no access to metal and 
hence no copper strings. As a substitute, players have to harvest the plants in game and use their fibers to create strings of different tension and assemble a playable guitar. 

**Preparation**

There are various alien species and each of them are vulnerable to different chords. Before each battle, the player will receive intel report on the makeup 
of the next wave of aliens. Correspondingly, they will need to determine the best note combination for their guitar that can effectively strike the 
weakness of the enemy.

**Arena**

After assembling the right guitar, the player will face yet another challenge during the actual combat. Playing the right chords is not enough to harm the aliens. The timing matters as well, chords will only be considered as an attack if it is played when the hexagonal blob is above the pinkish lane.

**_Todo_**

- Farm where player can use to grow their plants is not completed yet.
