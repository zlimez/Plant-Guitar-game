## :package: Resources/Assets Allowed
You are allowed to use as many or as little external resources as you require. However, you must:
- Document which external resources you're using in this README
- Be able to explain how your external library/asset works
- Explain why you chose this external library/asset and its pros and cons

## :thinking: What We're Looking For:
- Clean, modular coding style which allows for extensibility and easy integration with other external modules or API.
- Your ability to reason about your code and explain your design decisions & engineering choices during the review presentation.
- While visual flair is not required, more polished visuals are always appreciated.
- It is completely fine if you are not able to complete this problem to a 100% finished state. The main things we are looking for are a demonstrated ability to write code in a clean and modular way, while also paying attention to code optimality and performance.
