**Concept**

In the mini game, the player aim to repel alien invasion with their one and only guitar. In this postapocalyptic world, there is no access to metal and 
hence no copper strings. As a substitute, players have to gather different plants in real life (via the collection mechanism you mentioned in the meeting),
and use the fibers to create strings of different tension and assemble a playable guitar. 

Preparation

There are various alien species and each of them are vulnerable to different chords. Before each battle, the player will receive intel report on the makeup 
of the next wave of aliens. Correspondingly, they will need to determine the best note combination for their guitar that can effectively strike the 
weakness of the enemy.

Arena

After assembling the right guitar, the player will face yet another challenge during the actual combat. Playing the right chords is not enough to harm the aliens. The timing matters as well, chords will only be considered as an attack if it is played when the hexagonal blob is above the pinkish lane.

Completed:

- Main arena where the players engage the aliens
- Conversion of plant to guitar strings completed.

Todo:

- Attaching the strings to the guitar incomplete.

Notes:

- Each string can only be used once. Player must keep collecting plants in real life to maintain their string supply.
- Each alien has one major and one minor weakness.
- As for now, each wave of aliens will consist of 4 alien species, with two of the species being the main force. The makeup is generated randomly with the constraint that given six strings the player can always assemble a guitar that cover at least one of the two weakness of every alien.
- Can be modified such that the blobs are generated with some rhythmic nature instead of just interpolating between the climax and the start and end of the battle.
